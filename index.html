	<h2>Hello World !! </h2>
	<p>I am Vikash, an engineer who loves to build things. Originally form Nepal, living in New York and challenging myself one day at a time.</p>

	<h3>Projects</h3>

		<h3>UI Component based on Angular 2 and D3</h3>
		<p>As a challenge, I built an Angular 2 app which is getting the data from a dummy file and representing it using D3.JS</p>

		<p>You can find more about it <a href="https://vkd225.github.io/Angular2-UI/">here</a></p>

    <h3>React aware iFrame container</h3>
    <p>In one of the projects for a client, one of the part in a module was that I was trying to create a React aware iFrame. It is a widgets library, which would have multiple widgets based on ReactJs and you can drag and drop those widgets inside another container.</p>

    <p>Please find the working link <a href="/reactApp.html">here</a></p>

    <p>I also created a Image Widget where you can render an image based on url to show the working flow of the project. The components and dropdowns are created using Material UI. </p>

    <p> To edit the image, click on edit and paste a valid image url in "image via URL" tab.</p>

    <h3>Alexa Skill</h3>
    <p>As a hackathon project, I created an Alexa Skill called Supernova and hosted it on AWS Lambda to give out company's information and notify employee about the meeting scheduled for the day and also if the visitor has arrived in the office area.</p>
