        <h3>React aware iFrame container</h3>
        <p>In one of the projects for a client, one of the part in a module was that I was trying to create a React aware iFrame. It is a widgets library, which would have multiple widgets based on ReactJs and you can drag and drop those widgets inside another container.</p>

        <p>Please find the working link <a href="/reactApp.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

        <p>I also created a Image Widget where you can render an image based on url to show the working flow of the project. The components and dropdowns are created using Material UI. </p>

        <p> To edit the image, click on edit and paste a valid image url in "image via URL" tab.</p>
